You got job interview with Amazon...

This is my once in a life time to interview with a big global IT company.
Honestly, I'm not interested in Job Hunting but this one is really trembling me.

First, I got approached by recruiter from Linked In.
She said about the new opportunity for big IT company based in Seattle.

I know it at the first thought that it will be Amazon.
That because, I've read through a lot of blogs about AWS.

Then, I prepared resume for recruiter to apply it for me.
After 2 weeks passed, I got an email that I got an opportunity to have job interview at Amazon Japan in next week.

For interview at big IT company like Google, Facebook and Amazon,
I knew that I do need a practice in programming, data structure and some algorithm.
So, I read and do some exercise when I hearded about this opportunity from a site  
[GeekForFeek](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/),[CareerCup](https://www.careercup.com/) 
and read a book [Cracking the Coding Interviews](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850).

And this is the real thing with I found on interview:

1. You need to writing on Whiteboard to describe about your ideas, opinion and answer.
2. All you have for programming is notepad :)
3. Here is some answers that I can remember.
 - Design parking system
 - Write the binary tree search function.
 - Write how the stack work (push, pop)
 - Write down the insert function in Heap

Because I did some practice in Java, I tried to answer it all in Java also.
And I can finish it all in terminal. (Use vim as editor and compile it with javac)

And that's it... I got rejected from Amazon.
