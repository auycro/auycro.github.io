```
:r foo.txt
:!sh
:s/bar/BAR/g
gU shift+->
```

Sometimes when I was using vim or vi,
I usually forgot some commands and got struck with pasting auto-index,
replacing the wrong text because of case-sensitive and blah blah blah.

I'm always searching for the commands but suddenly forget them as soon as the file is saved. LOL

So I decided to create vim's [memo](https://auycro.github.io/vi_memo/) for myself :)
