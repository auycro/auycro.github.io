Just reminding to myself:

As recently, I'm so tired of myself being unproductive.
I decided to focus more on the coding challenge.

In the past, I did some challenges with Codility or Google Foobar.
But I never take it seriously just solved and put it in a gist.

Now I'm gonna put it in this [repo](https://github.com/auycro/code-practice).
